Development containers are a VS Code feature that allows developers to package a local development tool stack into the internals of a Docker container while also bringing the VS Code UI experience with them.

This very website is developed using DevContainers, see [.devcontainer/](https://github.com/cbast/website/tree/main/.devcontainer) on Github.
